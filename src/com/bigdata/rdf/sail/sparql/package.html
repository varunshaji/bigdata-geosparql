This package was imported from the <code>org.openrdf.query.parser.sparql</code>
package of the openrdf distribution.  The SPARQL grammar file is substantially
the same, though there are some bigdata specific extensions.  The code to build
the bigdata AST from the parser AST is completely new.

In order to avoid classpath ordering problems, all classes in the packages have
now been imported into a new package namespace.
